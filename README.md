# Updates / ChangeLog

10/19/2023

A bunch of the URL's were changed if anyone was wondering why Some of the radios aren't working,
I was able to fix the moose As the new link it switched to is supported,
Unfortunately all these are not and I will have to completely rewrite the player in order to support them,
Which I am not sure what I'm gonna have time to do that :( 
 
Here are the new links in case anyone wants them:

WTOS 105.3 FM "https://prod-3-85-73-255.amperwave.net/blueberry-wtosfmaac-hlsc1.m3u8"

Bee 98.5 FM "https://prod-3-95-159-36.amperwave.net/townsquare-webbfmaac-hlsc3.m3u8"

Frank 107.5 FM "https://live.amperwave.net/manifest/binnie-wfnkfmaac-hlsc.m3u8"

The Bear 97.1 FM "https://live.amperwave.net/manifest/blueberry-wbfbfmaac-hlsc1.m3u8"

WCYY 94.3 FM "https://prod-3-95-159-36.amperwave.net/townsquare-wcyyfmaac-hlsc3.m3u8"

The BetaPlayer shound now have a working "The Moose 92.3 FM"
